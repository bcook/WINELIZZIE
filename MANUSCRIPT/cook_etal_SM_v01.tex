\section*{Regional Harvest Date Analyses}
\noindent To analyze each region individually, we regressed each harvest date time series used in GHD-Core against CRU climate data averaged within one degree of that site location. As with GHD-Core, temperature is the dominant control on harvest in all eight regional series (Supplementary Figures 4--11), and all the temperature regressions are highly significant ($p\le0.01$). For the period 1901--1980, the temperature sensitivities (regression slopes) across sites range from $-3.70$ days \textsuperscript{o}C\textsuperscript{--1} at SRv to $-7.39$ days \textsuperscript{o}C\textsuperscript{--1} at Cha1. Significant ($p\le0.05$) moisture sensitivities (precipitation and PDSI) are also found at seven of the eight sites: Als, Bor, Bur, Cha1, Lan, LLV, and Swi. At the eighth site, SRv, the precipitation regression is marginally significant ($p=0.055$) and is insignificant for PDSI.\\
\indent At all sites, temperature sensitivities are still significant for the 1981--2007 interval, indicating that temperature remains an important control on winegrape phenology in more recent decades. By contrast, most sites show a significant weakening of the two moisture sensitivities. Both the precipitation and PDSI regressions with harvest dates become (or remain) insignificant ($p>0.05$) during 1981--2007 for Bor, Bur, Cha1, Lan, LLV, and Swi. At SRv, precipitation was already only marginally significant for 1901--1980, and this regression weakens considerably. At Als, the PDSI regression becomes insignificant, while precipitation does not change appreciably. Analyses of the individual regional harvest date series therefore support the general conclusions drawn from analyses of the GHD-Core composite index, demonstrating an overall large-scale weakening of moisture controls on grape harvest dates in France and Switzerland.

\section*{Temperature versus Moisture Comparisons}
\noindent We hypothesize that, in Western Europe, moisture impacts on winegrape phenology occur primarily through the indirect effect of moisture on growing season temperatures. Further, we argue that because of anthropogenic warming trends in recent decades, winegrape phenology has become decoupled from moisture variability. Here we, present evidence in support of these hypotheses.\\
\indent A strong connection between soil moisture and warm season temperatures over the Mediterranean and Western Europe has been well established \cite{Fischer2007,Miralles2014}, occurring primarily through the control of soil moisture on surface energy partitioning. In regions where evapotranspiration is limited by the supply of moisture at the surface, wetter soils will lead to increases in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux at the expense of sensible heating, keeping surface soil and air temperatures relatively cool. Conversely, if soils are dry, sensible heat fluxes will dominate, and soil and air temperatures will be higher. If these are the primary physics operating in our GHD-Core region, we would therefore expect negative relationships between temperature and precipitation or PDSI during the spring and summer.\\
\indent Indeed, for both MJJ (Supplementary Figure 12) and JJA (Supplementary Figure 14) we can see significant negative relationships between both temperature and precipitation and PDSI during the 1901--1980 interval. The relationships are generally stronger during JJA, when solar energy inputs are larger and land-atmosphere interactions are expected to be stronger. During the more recent interval (1981--2007), the temperature-moisture relationships generally weaken, especially during JJA. Additionally, temperatures during 1981--2007 are substantially warmer compared to 1901--1980, reflecting recent warming trends driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing. This additional warmth (unrelated to moisture variability), combined with the apparent weakening of the temperature-moisture coupling strength itself, supports our conclusions regarding the mechanisms by which moisture influences grape harvest date variability and the recent weakening of this relationship.

\section*{Monte-Carlo Analyses}
\noindent Interpretations of the composite climate anomaly analyses (Figure 4, main manuscript) and comparisons of climate distributions (Supplemental Figure 15, top panel) for extreme early harvest years may be affected by sampling uncertainties or biases, especially during the post 1980 period when the number of years to sample from is small. For example, from 1600--1980, 72 years qualify as early harvests with GHD-Core anomalies of $-7.67$ days or earlier. Because of the terminal years in the climate reconstructions (2012 for PDSI, 2002 for temperature, 2000 for precipitation), however, from 1981 to 2007 only 18 years qualify for PDSI, 13 years for temperature, and 11 years for precipitation. To estimate the impact on our analyses of these potential sampling uncertainties, we conducted a Monte-Carlo analysis where, in each of 10,000 iterations, we resampled climate anomalies from the early harvest years with replacement for the 1600--1980 period. In each iteration, we resampled $n$ times, where $n$ is equal to the number of early harvest years from 1981--2007 (so 11 for precipitation, 13 for temperature, and 18 for PDSI).\\
\indent Kernal density functions for the 10,000 resampled mean precipitation and PDSI anomalies are shown in the bottom panels of Supplemental Figure 15. As in the main analysis, PDSI shows the strongest shift with early harvest dates before and after 1980. Repeating the One Sided Student's t-test during each of these iterations found significant differences ($p\le0.05$) in 99\% of cases, indicating our earlier finding (drought, as represented by PDSI, is no longer associated with early harvests post-1980) is quite robust. The Monte-Carlo results were not as robust for precipitation: only 29\% of the iterations found marginally significantly ($p\le0.10$) drier conditions during the pre-1980 period compared to post-1980. In the precipitation reconstruction, however, we are severely limited in our sample size post-1980 (only 11 years, compared to 18 for PDSI). Our conclusions, however, are still strongly supported by both the observational analysis (using 20\textsuperscript{th} century climate data) and the PDSI reconstruction.

\caption{Same as Supplemental Figure 12, but for June-July-August (JJA) climate. During JJA, the temperature moisture relationship is stronger over this region and, in both precipitation and PDSI, these relationships breakdown in the recent decades (1981--2007).}

\caption{Top row: box plots of pooled precipitation and PDSI anomalies from the climate reconstructions for years with early harvest date anomalies in GHD-Core. Bottom row: kernel density functions of recalculated mean precipitation and PDSI anomalies associated with early harvest dates, based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo resamplings with replacement. Dashed vertical lines represent the mean anomalies calculated from the actual early harvest years from 1600--1980 (blue) and 1981--2007 (green).}
